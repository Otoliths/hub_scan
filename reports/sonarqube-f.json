This bug is timing-dependent and may occur only sporadically depending on network delays. The greatest security relevance is in use cases where a proxy is used to help with privacy/anonymity, even though there is no technical barrier to a direct connection. NOTE: versions before 2.60 are unaffected.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1160668","https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/issues/1989","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5RIFEDSRJ4P3WFCMDUOFQ2LEILZLMDW7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KJMLGW55HOQXHMTIPH2PWXFRBNBWVO4W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MEM7MMAXMWCDPUH4MTUZ763MBB64RRLJ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200127-0001/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-11501","PkgName":"gnutls","InstalledVersion":"3.6.10-r0","FixedVersion":"3.6.10-r1","Title":"gnutls: DTLS client hello contains a random value of all zeroes","Description":"GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.13 uses incorrect cryptography for DTLS.
