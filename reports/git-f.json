However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=12334","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620","https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1019"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-19126","PkgName":"multiarch-support","InstalledVersion":"2.23-0ubuntu10","Title":"glibc: LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC not ignored in setuid binaries","Description":"On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library (aka glibc) before 2.31 fails to ignore the LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.","Severity":"LOW","References":["http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-19126.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1828.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4FQ5LC6JOYSOYFPRUZ4S45KL6IP3RPPZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZFJ5E7NWOL6ROE5QVICHKIOUGCPFJVUH/","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25204"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-10029","PkgName":"multiarch-support","InstalledVersion":"2.23-0ubuntu10","Title":"glibc: stack corruption from crafted input in cosl, sinl, sincosl, and tanl functions","Description":"The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets.
