The earliest affected version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client always uses 32 '\\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-11501.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1998.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00015.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11501","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/commit/5b595e8e52653f6c5726a4cdd8fddeb6e83804d2","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/960","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ILMOWPKMTZAIMK5F32TUMO34XCABUCFJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WDYY3R4F5CUTFAMXH2C5NKYFVDEJLTT7/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-06","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200416-0002/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4322-1/","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4652","https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-03-31","https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-dtls-all-zero-clienthellorandom-vulnerability"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-13777","PkgName":"gnutls","InstalledVersion":"3.6.7-r0","FixedVersion":"3.6.14-r0","Title":"gnutls: session resumption works without master key allowing MITM","Description":"GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.14 uses incorrect cryptography for encrypting a session ticket (a loss of confidentiality in TLS 1.2, and an authentication bypass in TLS 1.3).
