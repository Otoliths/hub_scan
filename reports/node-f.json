The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=12334","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620","https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1019"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-19126","PkgName":"libc6-dev","InstalledVersion":"2.24-11+deb9u4","Title":"glibc: LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC not ignored in setuid binaries","Description":"On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library (aka glibc) before 2.31 fails to ignore the LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.","Severity":"LOW","References":["http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-19126.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1828.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4FQ5LC6JOYSOYFPRUZ4S45KL6IP3RPPZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZFJ5E7NWOL6ROE5QVICHKIOUGCPFJVUH/","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25204"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-7309","PkgName":"libc6-dev","InstalledVersion":"2.24-11+deb9u4","Title":"glibc: memcmp function incorrectly returns zero","Description":"In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, the memcmp function for the x32 architecture can incorrectly return zero (indicating that the inputs are equal) because the RDX most significant bit is mishandled.","Severity":"LOW","References":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106835","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7309","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202006-04","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24155","https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2019-02/msg00041.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-10029","PkgName":"libc6-dev","InstalledVersion":"2.24-11+deb9u4","Title":"glibc: stack corruption from crafted input in cosl, sinl, sincosl, and tanl functions","Description":"The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets.

An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-16056.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1764.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00062.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00063.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00012.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00021.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00040.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3725","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3948","https://bugs.python.org/issue34155","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16056","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8cb65d1381b027f0b09ee36bfed7f35bb4dec9a9","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/09/msg00018.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/09/msg00019.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4X3HW5JRZ7GCPSR7UHJOLD7AWLTQCDVR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BEARDOTXCYPYELKBD2KWZ27GSPXDI3GQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/COATURTCY7G67AYI6UDV5B2JZTBCKIDX/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E2HP37NUVLQSBW3J735A2DQDOZ4ZGBLY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ER6LONC2B2WYIO56GBQUDU6QTWZDPUNQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JCPGLTTOBB3QEARDX4JOYURP6ELNNA2V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K4KZEFP6E4YPYB52AF4WXCUDSGQOTF37/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K7HNVIFMETMFWWWUNTB72KYJYXCZOS5V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M34WOYCDKTDE5KLUACE2YIEH7D37KHRX/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NF3DRDGMVIRYNZMSLJIHNW47HOUQYXVG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OYGESQSGIHDCIGOBVF7VXCMIE6YDWRYB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QASRD4E2G65GGEHYKVHYCXB2XWAGTNL4/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QP46PQSUKYPGWTADQ67NOV3BUN6JM34Z/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SDQQ56P7ZZR64XV5DUVWNSNXKKEXUG2J/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZBTGPBUABGXZ7WH7677OEM3NSP6ZEA76/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190926-0005/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4151-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4151-2/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-16935","PkgName":"libpython2.7-minimal","InstalledVersion":"2.7.13-2+deb9u3","Title":"python: XSS vulnerability in the documentation XML-RPC server in server_title field","Description":"The documentation XML-RPC server in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4 has XSS via the server_title field.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-8492","PkgName":"libpython2.7-stdlib","InstalledVersion":"2.7.13-2+deb9u3","Title":"python: wrong backtracking in urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler allows for a ReDoS","Description":"Python 2.7 through 2.7.17, 3.5 through 3.5.9, 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.6, and 3.8 through 3.8.1 allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00003.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue39503","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/18284","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7WOKDEXLYW5UQ4S7PA7E37IITOC7C56J/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/APGWEMYZIY5VHLCSZ3HD67PA5Z2UQFGH/","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/urllib-basic-auth-regex.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200221-0001/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-2/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2013-7040","PkgName":"libpython2.7-stdlib","InstalledVersion":"2.7.13-2+deb9u3","Title":"python: hash secret can be recovered remotely","Description":"Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to randomize hash values, which causes it to compute hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably and makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.

This affects 2.x through 2.7.16, 3.x before 3.4.10, 3.5.x before 3.5.7, 3.6.x before 3.6.9, and 3.7.x before 3.7.3.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2018-20852.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1764.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00071.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00074.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00040.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3725","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3948","https://bugs.python.org/issue35121","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20852","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00040.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/COATURTCY7G67AYI6UDV5B2JZTBCKIDX/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K7HNVIFMETMFWWWUNTB72KYJYXCZOS5V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZBTGPBUABGXZ7WH7677OEM3NSP6ZEA76/","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/cookie-domain-check.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-26","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4127-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4127-2/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-16056","PkgName":"libpython3.5-minimal","InstalledVersion":"3.5.3-1+deb9u1","Title":"python: email.utils.parseaddr wrongly parses email addresses","Description":"An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-8492","PkgName":"python2.7-minimal","InstalledVersion":"2.7.13-2+deb9u3","Title":"python: wrong backtracking in urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler allows for a ReDoS","Description":"Python 2.7 through 2.7.17, 3.5 through 3.5.9, 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.6, and 3.8 through 3.8.1 allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00003.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue39503","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/18284","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7WOKDEXLYW5UQ4S7PA7E37IITOC7C56J/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/APGWEMYZIY5VHLCSZ3HD67PA5Z2UQFGH/","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/urllib-basic-auth-regex.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200221-0001/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-2/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2013-7040","PkgName":"python2.7-minimal","InstalledVersion":"2.7.13-2+deb9u3","Title":"python: hash secret can be recovered remotely","Description":"Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to randomize hash values, which causes it to compute hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably and makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.

An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-16056.html","http://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1764.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00062.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00063.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00012.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-11/msg00021.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00040.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3725","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3948","https://bugs.python.org/issue34155","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16056","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8cb65d1381b027f0b09ee36bfed7f35bb4dec9a9","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/09/msg00018.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/09/msg00019.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4X3HW5JRZ7GCPSR7UHJOLD7AWLTQCDVR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BEARDOTXCYPYELKBD2KWZ27GSPXDI3GQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/COATURTCY7G67AYI6UDV5B2JZTBCKIDX/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E2HP37NUVLQSBW3J735A2DQDOZ4ZGBLY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ER6LONC2B2WYIO56GBQUDU6QTWZDPUNQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JCPGLTTOBB3QEARDX4JOYURP6ELNNA2V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K4KZEFP6E4YPYB52AF4WXCUDSGQOTF37/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K7HNVIFMETMFWWWUNTB72KYJYXCZOS5V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M34WOYCDKTDE5KLUACE2YIEH7D37KHRX/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NF3DRDGMVIRYNZMSLJIHNW47HOUQYXVG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OYGESQSGIHDCIGOBVF7VXCMIE6YDWRYB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QASRD4E2G65GGEHYKVHYCXB2XWAGTNL4/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QP46PQSUKYPGWTADQ67NOV3BUN6JM34Z/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SDQQ56P7ZZR64XV5DUVWNSNXKKEXUG2J/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZBTGPBUABGXZ7WH7677OEM3NSP6ZEA76/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190926-0005/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4151-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4151-2/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-16935","PkgName":"python2.7-minimal","InstalledVersion":"2.7.13-2+deb9u3","Title":"python: XSS vulnerability in the documentation XML-RPC server in server_title field","Description":"The documentation XML-RPC server in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4 has XSS via the server_title field.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-8492","PkgName":"python3.5","InstalledVersion":"3.5.3-1+deb9u1","Title":"python: wrong backtracking in urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler allows for a ReDoS","Description":"Python 2.7 through 2.7.17, 3.5 through 3.5.9, 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.6, and 3.8 through 3.8.1 allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00003.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue39503","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/18284","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7WOKDEXLYW5UQ4S7PA7E37IITOC7C56J/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/APGWEMYZIY5VHLCSZ3HD67PA5Z2UQFGH/","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/urllib-basic-auth-regex.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200221-0001/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-2/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-17522","PkgName":"python3.5","InstalledVersion":"3.5.3-1+deb9u1","Title":"python: Command injection in Lib/webbrowser.py","Description":"** DISPUTED ** Lib/webbrowser.py in Python through 3.6.3 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL.
